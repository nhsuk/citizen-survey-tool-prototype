      <p>This survey will help the NHS understand more about how and where coronavirus (COVID-19) is affecting people now.</p>

      <p>By answering some quick questions, you can help the NHS plan its response to coronavirus.</p>

      <p>The NHS especially wants to hear from you if you have symptoms, no matter how mild. But it also helps if you let us know if youâ€™re feeling OK.</p>

      <p>You can fill in this survey for yourself or for someone else, like a child or an elderly relative. If the person is aged 13 and over, check that they are happy for you to complete the survey for them.</p>
